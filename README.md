# Slow API

> The slow learning of FastAPI  
> **But to the right direction**  

- day 0 server memo : client + server + memo, http request + response, cors  
- day 1 access gate : user + token + memos, fake db(memory), signup + login, request + header, http + path query headers body + method, dependency injection, flask(explicit, imperative, request-driven, low-level) vs fastapi(implicit, declarative, contract-driven, high-level), depends + framework, access control, localStorage vs cookie, xss vs csrf  
- day 2 owner control : update + delete (crud on memory), route(http method + path + process), http message(method + path(+query) + version + headers + blank line + (body)), http + tcp + ip + ethernet/wifi + physical layer, https(http + tls)  
- day 3 unified origin : serving staticfiles, origin(protocol + host + port), route shadowing  
- day 4 personal calendar : same structure as the memo service  
- day 5 event control : authorization vs authentication, resource id
